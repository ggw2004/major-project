# Project Reflection
## Advice to self if doing this again
   - If I were to do this project again advice I would give to myself would be create the movement functions on a seperate sketch.js file until they are working properly. This is so I could do trial and error in a much easier fashion. Furthermore, I would tell myself to use the debugger much sooner and to create a T-chart of what I think variables in my code are set to at which time allowing me a reference sheet to look back on.

## Hardest Part of Project
   - The most difficult challenge I faced during the construction of this project was the vertical movement functions. This was the most difficult part of the project as I struggled to keep track of the grid boundaries and values; therefore, in the early stages of creating the vertical movement functions, it would either check for a cell in the grid that did not exist, would be caught in an infinite loop of changing the value of one cell with the value of its neighbour, or would not move the tiles to the furthest vacant cell on the grid.
    
 ## Did you Complete the Needs to Have List?
    - Yes I completed the need to have list.
    
 ## What are you most pround of?
    - In this project I would say I am most proud of the vertical movement functions as this is what I struggled with the most. Creating this function may have been easy for many others; however, as creating this function was a challenge for me, finallying solving this problem after working on it for a long time, makes me pround of it.
