- What he said:
  - The control instructions are a little close together. Maybe adjust the distance at which they are placed on the screen.
  - The text is difficult to read on the beginning screen.
 
 - What I've done:
  - Lenghened the space between the control instructions.
  - Bolded certain text or increased its size and put it in italics making it easier to read.
