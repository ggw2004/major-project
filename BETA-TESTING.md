# Major-Project Beta Tester(s)

## Beta Tester #1 Caleb - In Comp. Sci. 30
- What he said:
  - The control instructions are a little close together. Maybe adjust the distance at which they are placed on the screen.
  - The text is difficult to read on the beginning screen.
 
 - What I've done:
   - Lenghened the space between the control instructions.
   - Bolded certain text or increased its size and put it in italics making it easier to read.

## Beta tester #2 Arman
- What he said 
   - make tiles slide to their locations
   - add control over music/sound fx (volume, mute button)
   - add a timer
- What I did / said
  - the way my code is written to display the grid would require me to refactor my entire code to incorporate any additional display such as a button for volume or a display for a timer
  - When screen it checks if there is any number in the cell it is attempting to fill. If the cell is empty then the new cell is set to the value of the previous one and the old cell is set to zero which is not displayed. This process happens in a set order and the next cell cannot be changed until after the first cell completed this proceess. If I were to incorporate a slide function you would observe each tile slowly moving in a set order until it reaches its predetermined location.
