# Major Project Proposal

## Description

Tetris. A variety of seven different block shapes fall from the "sky" in a random order. It is the "players" job
to stack these block in a way that fulls up a full row. Once a row it full it will delete itself creating more 
room for the next falling blocks.


## Must Have List

- A system to keep score
- Have all seven tetris blocks
- A full row deletes itself
- The rotation of blocks when a specific key is clicked

## Nice to Have List

- Observe how the block will be place once it reaches the bottom
- The ability to hold a single block & hopefully be able to recall the block
- A function to preview the next block
- Speed up the decent of a block while a specific key is pressed
- a restart button
