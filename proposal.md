# Major Project Proposal

## Description

2048. In a four by four grid, slide numbered tiles, which add together once they collide, in an attempt to create a tile with the number 2048; however, the player can continue to add tiles reaching numbers greater than 2048.


## Must Have List

- Four by four grid
- The increase of equal numbers once they collide
- At the beginning of the game two numbers appear in a ranodm spot on the four by four grid
- A new block containing a number appears after every move
- Blocks slide to the fartherest point in the direction indicated by the arrow or key pressed (up, down, right, left, w, s, a, d), and only add together if they contain the same value
- Blocks do not slide off of the four by four grid


## Nice to Have List

- The new numbers whichs appear after a move is 2 or 4 not just 2
- Reset/restart button
- Color of the block is based on its numerical value
- the four by four grid appears in the middle of the screen
- the numbers are in the center of the square
- Background music / sound effects
