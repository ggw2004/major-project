# Major Project Proposal

## Description

2048. In a four by four grid, slide numbered tiles, which add together once they collide, in an attempt to create a tile with the number 2048; however, the player can continue to add tiles reaching numbers greater than 2048.


## Must Have List

- Four by four grid
- The increase of equal numbers once they collide
- At the beginning of the game two numbers (either a 2 or a 4) appear in a ranodm cell on the four by four grid
- A new block (either a 2 or a 4) appears in an empty cell after every move
- Blocks slide to the fartherest vacent cell in the direction indicated by the arrow or key pressed (up, down, right, left, w, s, a, d)
- If two cells of the same value colldie with one another they will add together
- Blocks do not slide off of the four by four grid


## Nice to Have List

- Reset/restart button
- Color of the block is based on its numerical value
- the four by four grid appears in the middle of the screen
- the numbers are in the center of the square
- Background music / sound effects
