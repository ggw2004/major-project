# Major Project Proposal

## Description

2048. In a four by four grid, slide numbered tiles, which add together once they collide, in an attempt to create a tile with the number 2048; however, the player can continue to add tiles reaching numbers greater than 2048.


## Must Have List
- Four by four grid
- The increase of equal numbers once they collide
- At the beginning of the game two numbers appear in a ranodm spot on the four by four grid
- A new block containing a number, which is a multiple of 2, appears after every move
- Blocks slide to the fartherest point in the direction indicated by the arrow or key pressed (up, down, right, left), and only add together if they contain the same value
- Blocks do not slide off of the four by four grid

## Nice to Have List

- The new numbers whichs appear after a move is 2 or 4 not just 2
- Reset/restart button
- Color of the block is based on its numerical value
- the four by four grid appears in the middle of the screen
- the numbers are in the center of the square



Observe how the block will be place once it reaches the bottom
- The ability to hold a single block & hopefully be able to recall the block
- A function to preview the next block
- Speed up the decent of a block while a specific key is pressed
- a restart button
