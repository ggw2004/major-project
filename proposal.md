# Major Project Proposal

## Description

2048. In a four by four grid, slide numbered tiles, which add together once they collide, in an attempt to create a tile with the number 2048; however, the player can continue to add tiles reaching numbers greater than 2048.


## Must Have List

- A system to keep score
- Have all seven tetris blocks
- A full row deletes itself
- The rotation of blocks when a specific key is clicked

## Nice to Have List

- Observe how the block will be place once it reaches the bottom
- The ability to hold a single block & hopefully be able to recall the block
- A function to preview the next block
- Speed up the decent of a block while a specific key is pressed
- a restart button
