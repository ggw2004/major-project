# Major Project Proposal

## Description

2048. In a four by four grid, slide numbered tiles, which add together once they collide, in an attempt to create a tile with the number 2048; however, the player can continue to add tiles reaching numbers greater than 2048.


## Must Have List

- Four by four grid
- The increase of equal numbers once they collide
- At the beginning of the game two numbers (either a 2 or a 4) appear in a ranodm cell on the four by four grid
- A new block (either a 2 or a 4) appears in an empty cell after every move
- Blocks slide to the fartherest vacent cell in the direction indicated by the arrow or key pressed (up, down, right, left, w, s, a, d)
- If two cells of the same value collide with one another they will add together. The cell at the farthest point on the grid of the indicated direction will set to the added value and the other cell being set to as zero (vacant). 
   - If a neighbouring cell is being moved in the same row or column of the two recently added cells, the now vacant cell will be set to the value of the neighbour cell moving in      the indicated direction. The neigbouring cell will be set to zero.
- Blocks do not slide off of the four by four grid


## Nice to Have List

- Reset/restart button
- Color of the block is based on its numerical value
- the four by four grid appears in the middle of the screen
- the numbers are in the center of the square
- Background music / sound effects
